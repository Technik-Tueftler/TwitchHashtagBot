## Summary Feature
1. Collect and post hashtags
2. Post new clips
3. Stream start message

## Feature
1. Collects hashtags in the broadcaster's Twitch chat and posts them to the configured Discord channel at the end of the stream or when a command is executed. It can be set that only hashtags with a configurable rank are collected (Vips, Mods, Broadcaster). You can also specify whether the hashtag function should be started or ended with the start or end of the stream and thus be posted automatically.
2. If a new clip is created in your stream, it can also be posted on the Discord channel. 
3. When your stream starts, a message is sent to the Discord channel. You can customize this message and pass parameters.
4. Suppressing hashtags for the post via a blacklist and adding them via a command


## Installation / Execution
1. Runs the program locally by executing the main file. To do this, simply copy the repository and execute `main.py`. The settings must be loaded via the environment variables. The variables can be stored directly in the system or you can use an `.env` file. The `template.env` file can be used for this by renaming it to `.env` and writing the value to the required variables. The program was tested and developed under Python 3.11.
2. via a Docker container. Example see point ``Docker Compose Example`` below.

## What else is needed
- A twitch bot must be created via: https://dev.twitch.tv/console
- Discord WebHook connection, check `Supported platforms to broadcast`

## Supported platforms to broadcast
Currently only Discord is supported via WebHook. To do this, a new WebHook must be created in the server settings under `Integration`. Here you can also set the channel on which the notification should be sent.

**Example clip:** A clip from the current stream #link Thanks to #user for clipping.
**Example hashtag:** Highlights from stream: #hashtags, thanks to #chatter_except_last and #chatter_last for creating the highlights!"

## Suppressing hashtags
There is the option of not registering hashtags for the post and adding them to a blacklist. All hashtags are in the file **blacklist.txt** and can be added there manually before the bot starts. While the bot is running, this is possible at any time via the chat command and is also entered in the text document.
