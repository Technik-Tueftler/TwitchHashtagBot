## Installation / Execution
1. locally runs the program by executing the main file. To do this, simply copy the repository and run `main.py`. Currently, first environment variables must be loaded into the IDE or environment. The login information can also be stored in ``/files/config.json``. The program was tested and developed under Python 3.11.
2. via a Docker container. Example see point ``Docker Compose Example`` below.

## What else is needed
- A twitch bot must be created via: https://dev.twitch.tv/console
- Discord WebHook connection, check `Supported platforms to broadcast`

## Supported platforms to broadcast
Currently only Discord is supported via WebHook. To do this, a new WebHook must be created in the server settings under Integration. Here you can also set the channel on which the notification should be sent.
